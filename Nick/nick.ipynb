The second part is based on the real-world hiring test that the Analyst Institute used to screen their data analysts. Analyst Institute is a consulting firm that works with progressive and Democratic groups in conducting randomized field experiments. You will be analyzing an experiment the Analyst Institute conducted. \n",

    "In 2017, one of their partners was interested in determining the effectiveness of an SMS (text message) persuasion program on likely voters. The campaign hoped their text messages would both persuade voters to support candidate Jane Smith over her opponents, and mobilize voters to cast a ballot in their state’s 2017 general election. Voters were randomly assigned to receive one of three interventions (`sms_treat`):\n",

    "- No contact (Control group, `sms_treat = Control`)\n",
    "- Message reminding them to vote in the upcoming election with no persuasion message (First treatment group, `sms_treat = Treat Reminder Only`)\n",
    "- Message that **both** reminds them to vote in the upcoming election and highlights Smith’s record on environmental issues (Second treatment group, `sms_treat = Treat Reminder + Enviro`)\n",
    "\n",
    "After the SMS program was implemented, Analyst Institute conducted a live phone survey asking voters which candidate they planned to support in the upcoming election. After the election, they consulted publicly-available state voter files to measure whether the targeted voters actually voted on Election Day. **For the purposes of this midterm, do not worry about any missing data or implementing survey weights.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The three main research questions were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Was the experiment properly implemented (balance check between treatment and control on the pre-treatment covariates)?\n",
    "2. Did the message program increase voters’ likelihood to vote?\n",
    "3. Did the message program persuade voters to support Jane Smith?\n",
